An argument you could make for a unique pointer is that it takes up less
memory than a shared pointer because you only have take up 2 spaces in
memory for the pointer itself and the object it points to, whereas a 
shared pointer takes 3 spaces in memroy - the two previously mentioned
spots as well as a place in memory for keeping track of the reference
counting.

Another case for the unique pointer is when you have a (rare) situation
where you explicitly only want a single thing pointing to a particular 
object. This could be a useful semnatical distinction when working on
code with others to ensure that nothing else points at that object.
This could be seen as a potential security/encapsulation measure.
Ie, it's easier to keep a secret if it's only shared with a single person
rather than the information being available to everyone.
